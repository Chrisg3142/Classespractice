# Classespractice

This program was just a practice with classes to get a better understanding of how they work and how they can be used in certain situations. 
I still have more to learn about classes before I can master them but I have a feeling that I got a better understanding by practicing with this program.
This program check the qualifications of someone applying for a certain position at a company. I made some of the test variables have incosistant capitalization to test and see how the program takes it. The data the class intakes is someones first name, age, position they are applying for, and years of experiences. The False is just there since it stands for if they have been hired or not. 
The print statement for number of employees is just to make sure the program tracks how many people got hired and adding them to the current number of employees while also making sure it does not add someone to the number of employees if they have not been hired.
